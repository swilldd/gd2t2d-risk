# Gestational Diabetes to Type 2 Diabetes Risk Prediction

## Problem statement

This project intends to predict risk of Type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes. According to Dennison et al(2020), 33% of women who suffered with gestational diabetes will also develop type II diabetes within 15 years. Being able to reliably and explainably predict at risk patients allows for health services to take a proactive action. 

## How can we measure success?

This problem was explored by Prashanthan and Prashanthan (2025) in a study where they managed to acheive the following metrics using an AdaBoost classifier:
- Accuracy - 0.89
- Precision - 0.74
- Recall - 0.88
- F1 score - 0.80

This project will aim to replicate this performance or better, whilst minising Type II errors (false negatives) which would lead to support not being directed to mothers that need it the most.
